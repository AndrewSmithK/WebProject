        <p className="text text-grey">
          For the conduct of its business, Qover has adopted the principle of managing in an honest, equitable and
          professional manner any conflicts of interest which may arise between Qover and its clients, a client and another
          party who act for Qover or among its clients. In accordance with the applicable law, Qover takes all necessary
          measures to identify and properly manage conflicts of interest which give rise to a significant risk of damage
          likely to harm the interests of its clients whether current, potential and former clients (hereinafter the "Client").
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          Conflicts of interest may arise between:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            Qover and a Client;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            a concerned person and Qover and/or a Client of Qover;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            several Qover clients in connection with the provision of services offered by Qover to these Clients;

            an intermediary/supplier of Qover and a Client.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          For the purposes of this policy on conflicts of interests, the term concerned person refers to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            an employee or manager of Qover or a representative appointed by Qover as well as any natural person
            whose services are made available to and are provided under the control of Qover and who is involved
            in Qover's regulated activities;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">

            1.2. Internal measures for the identification and management of conflicts of interests
          </b>
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          In order to identify these conflicts of interest, Qover focuses on facts and also does its best to determine, in
          particular, if a concerned person, or any other person:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            is likely to derive a financial gain or prevent a financial loss at the expense of the Client;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            has an interest in the outcome of a service provided to the Client or of a transaction carried out on behalf
            of that Client, which is distinct from the Client's interest in that outcome;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            has a financial or other incentive to favour the interest of Qover and/or a Client or group of Clients over
            the interests of Qover and/or another Client or an intermediary.
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            has the same professional activity as the Client; and/or
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            receives or shall receive from a person other than the Client an inducement in relation to the service
            provided to the Client, in the form of monies, goods or services, other than the standard commission or
            fee for that service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          When a conflict of interest is identified, it must be managed rapidly, equitably and adequately.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          Examples of basic measures laid out in the rules adopted by Qover are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            effective procedures to control the flow of information in situations involving the risk of a conflict of
            interest likely to damage the interests of a Client;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            appropriate controls to identify and manage multiple directorships and the concerned persons' interests
            outside the company;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            appropriate measures for the protection of information on Qover's services and activities when a conflict
            of interest is identified;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            where necessary, rules governing transactions by the personnel in their own name apply to the concerned
            persons;
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            a review of the adequacy of Qover's systems and controls is carried out on a regular basis.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          In the course of the management of a conflict of interest, it may be appropriate to have recourse to additional
          measures when the basic measures are not sufficient to adequately manage the potential conflict. These
          measures may include in particular the setting up “Chinese walls" on an ad hoc basis, specific to the transactions
          or other additional measures for the separation of information.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          Qover employees must ensure that they adopt fully independent attitudes in their dealings with clients and
          insurance intermediaries. This is why measures aimed at preventing any influence and guaranteeing an
          independent attitude have been introduced: separation of departments, prevention of improper intervention in
          some activities or services, policy on gifts and invitations.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          When it can reasonably be expected that any measures taken to manage a conflict of interest will not be
          sufficient to protect the clients’ interests, the clients concerned shall be informed of the general nature and/or of
          the sources of the conflict of interest. Information must be communicated prior to the provision of the product or
          to the implementation of the service with which the risk of conflict of interest is associated.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          The procedure for notification of unmanageable conflicts of interest must remain the exception and is subject to
          approval by the Compliance Officer. The aforementioned step is not to substitute for the development of conflict
          of interest management measures as laid out and required above.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          An additional support to the identification and management of conflicts of interest is provided through
          procedures and guidelines which have been set up in connection with other specific obligations.

          2. Information Qover's policy on inducements
        </h6>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          Qover enters into cooperation agreements with business introducers. Such agreement governs the rights and
          obligations of the parties, including the remuneration payable by Qover to the introducer.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          It is important to note that Qover’s relationships with insurers work differently from traditional players. A
          traditional insurer builds and manages its products (and the premium integrates such internal costs on top of the
          risk carrying) and then remunerates brokers who merely distribute its products.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-grey">
          As an InsurTech, it is important to highlight that Qover is not an additional intermediary in the traditional
          insurance value chain. Qover builds and manages insurance products as described below (and the role of the
          insurer is limited to risk carrying) and make it more cost-efficient. So in QOVER approach, the insurance premium
          is usually spread as follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            45 to 65 %: for the INSURER (to pay the claims)
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            5 to 35 %: for QOVER to cover its own expenses (portfolio management, marketing, operations, IT, actuary, etc.)
          </li>
          <li className="text text-grey">
            5 to 25 %: for the introducer
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div className="chain-icon" style={{width: 650 + 'px', height: 91.3 + 'px', background: '#f00'}} />
        <p className="text text-grey">
          Qover does not increase the cost of the insurance value chain but manages instead what the insurer traditionally
          do in a more efficient way ultimately aiming at a better user experience.
