These\n          measures may include in particular the setting up “Chinese walls\" on an ad hoc basis, specific to the transactions\n          or other additional measures for the separation of information.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          Qover employees must ensure that they adopt fully independent attitudes in their dealings with clients and\n          insurance intermediaries. This is why measures aimed at preventing any influence and guaranteeing an\n          independent attitude have been introduced: separation of departments, prevention of improper intervention in\n          some activities or services, policy on gifts and invitations.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          When it can reasonably be expected that any measures taken to manage a conflict of interest will not be\n          sufficient to protect the clients’ interests, the clients concerned shall be informed of the general nature and/or of\n          the sources of the conflict of interest. Information must be communicated prior to the provision of the product or\n          to the implementation of the service with which the risk of conflict of interest is associated.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          The procedure for notification of unmanageable conflicts of interest must remain the exception and is subject to\n          approval by the Compliance Officer. The aforementioned step is not to substitute for the development of conflict\n          of interest management measures as laid out and required above.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          An additional support to the identification and management of conflicts of interest is provided through\n          procedures and guidelines which have been set up in connection with other specific obligations.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"item\">\n        <h6 className=\"subtitle text-turquoise\">\n          2. Information Qover's policy on inducements\n        </h6>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          Qover enters into cooperation agreements with business introducers. Such agreement governs the rights and\n          obligations of the parties, including the remuneration payable by Qover to the introducer.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          It is important to note that Qover’s relationships with insurers work differently from traditional players. A\n          traditional insurer builds and manages its products (and the premium integrates such internal costs on top of the\n          risk carrying) and then remunerates brokers who merely distribute its products.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          As an InsurTech, it is important to highlight that Qover is not an additional intermediary in the traditional\n          insurance value chain. Qover builds and manages insurance products as described below (and the role of the\n          insurer is limited to risk carrying) and make it more cost-efficient. So in QOVER approach, the insurance premium\n          is usually spread as follow:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li className=\"text text-grey\">\n            45 to 65 %: for the INSURER (to pay the claims)\n          </li>\n          <li className=\"text text-grey\">\n            5 to 35 %: for QOVER to cover its own expenses (portfolio management, marketing, operations, IT, actuary, etc.)\n          </li>\n          <li className=\"text text-grey\">\n            5 to 25 %: for the introducer\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <div className=\"chain-icon\" style={{width: 650 + 'px', height: 91.3 + 'px', background: '#f00'}} />\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          Qover does not increase the cost of the insurance value chain but manages instead what the insurer traditionally\n          do in a more efficient way ultimately aiming at a better user experience.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          Should you wish to have more information on these policies, the Client can contact the Compliance Officer by e-\n          mail on the following address: <a href=\"mailto:compliance@qover.be\">compliance@qover.be</a> or by mail: Qover - Compliance Department – rue des\n          Palais 44 – 1030 Brussels - Belgium.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/Terms & Policies/TermsConflicts.jsx","import React from 'react';\n\nexport default class TermsCookies extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return <div className=\"text-container\">\n      <h5 className=\"title text-blue\">\n        Cookie policy\n      </h5>\n      <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n        <b>\n          We may collect information on you while visiting our website such as cookies and log data.\n        </b>\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"item\">\n        <h6 className=\"subtitle text-turquoise\">\n          Log data\n        </h6>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site (\"Log\n          Data\").\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type,\n          browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those\n          pages and other statistics.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyse this\n          information.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"item\">\n        <h6 className=\"subtitle text-turquoise\">\n          Cookies\n        </h6>\n        <p className=\"text text-grey\">\n          Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique i dentifier.
